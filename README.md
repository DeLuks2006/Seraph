<h2 align=center>Whats up with the name?</h2>
Well the Seraphim is a angel with 6 wings and my rootkit (should support) supports the following six features:

1. Hiding Files
2. Hiding Processes
3. Hiding Network Activity
4. Injecting Shellcode into User Mode Processes
5. C2 Beacon Communication (only for my custom mini-c2 server)
6. Keylogging

So I thought it would fit the name...
